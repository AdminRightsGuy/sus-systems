# sus-systems
Some of our guys are suspected over stealing data from the servers. Run the script on all our suspicious systems & we can analyse them later on.

The event handler seems to be the same for all the systems.

Make sure you delete the script after extraction to avoid suspicion. We need to catch them before they escape !
